# Web_Dictionary
A dictionary, in the context of computer programming, refers to a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as an associative array, map, or hash table in different programming languages. The dictionary allows you to retrieve values by their corresponding keys, similar to how words are looked up in a physical dictionary.
