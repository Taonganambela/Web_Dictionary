# Web_Dictionary
A dictionary, in the context of computer programming, refers to a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as an associative array, map, or hash table in different programming languages. The dictionary allows you to retrieve values by their corresponding keys, similar to how words are looked up in a physical dictionary.
Local storage provides a simple key-value storage system, similar to a dictionary. It allows you to store data as strings and retrieve it later using the associated keys. The data stored in local storage remains available to the web application even after page refreshes or when the user navigates away and returns to the website.
